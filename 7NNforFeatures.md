Exploring automation of Feature Engineering using Neural Netwroks


## Introduction:

Instead of doing Feature Engineering with hand by mean-encoding, breaking strings, trends, averages, combination of features etc. It would be nice if we could automate the feature engineering process. 

Main idea being that activations in hidden layers of a deep Neural Network, are combinations of input features, generally representing lower level details or patterns to higher level details of the input data. Using these details as input features in other type of models and investigate the effects of using hidden layer activations as input features(being automatically engineered by training a Neural Network).

Instead of X as input investigating the effects of using A1, A2, ... as inputs for model's training.

* To start Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle is used:
```
Columns = Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
shape = (768, 8)
```



* Fixed seed for reproducible results (still will vary a little):
```python
seed = 43
import os
import random as rn
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED']=str(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)
tf.random.set_seed(seed)
rn.seed(seed)
```


* Scale the data for 0 mean and unit std, using sklearn's StandardScaler()


* Neural Network build using Keras library, model.summary():
```

* Adam Optimizer:
```python
adam_opt = Adam(learning_rate=0.001,beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, amsgrad=False)
```



* Loss and Metric:
```python
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=adam_opt, metrics=['accuracy'])
```



* .fit() Hypreparameters:
```python
fit = model.fit(X_scl, Y, epochs=500, validation_split=0.3)
```
<hr>



* XGBoost model to measure the features importance:
```python
model = XGBClassifier(max_depth=7,
                      random_state=seed,
                      min_child_weight=15, 
                      learning_rate=0.001,
                      n_estimators=400)
```



* Feature Importamce in XGBoost model:

![pima dataset feature importance](images/pima_feature_importance.png)



* Getting Weights and bias for hidden layer and then Calculating activation for hidden layers, using calcActivation(model, X, act) function:
```python
# calculate activation for hidden layers
# a = g(z) = g(wx + b)
# (nl,m)   (nl,n)(n,m)  (nl,1)
```
<hr>

* a1 mostly 0.0000s, sparse dataframe with relu activation:
    - more hidden units than required?
    - check % of zeroes in features
    - L1 regularization?
- a1.sum():
    - only 6 non-zero features

## Observations:

- For both activations relu and tanh, a2 as input performs better than a1
- Near or better accuracy for both train and test with a2 than X
- Neural Network with X vs. XGBoost with a1 & a2:
    - relu:
        - a1 is little better in train and worse in test
        - a2 is better in train and same in test
    - tanh:
        - a1 is same in train and better in test
        - a2 is better in train and much better in test

- adding X in the input doesn't affect the final result that much.



<hr>

- Need to do:
    - New Dataset (bigger and with diverse uncorrelated features)
    - ~~abstract function to utilize both tanh and leakyrelu as activation~~
    - the increase in performance need to investegated further using a bigger Neural Network combined with big and diverse Data.
