- made score more important by increasing fitness 
  - definitely increased performance generation 6 reached score of 19

- change input to nnets from absolute value to -ve and +ve
  - generation 5 copter reached score of 25+

- added 1 hidden layer
  - generation 7's two copters reached score 22
  - change helped?
  - maybe, need deeper dive and running for a fixed saturated amount of time
  
- Can make the game run faster, by increasing the FPS constant
